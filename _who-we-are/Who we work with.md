# Media Literacy Councilâ€™s Partners

The MLC works in partnership with the people, private and public (3P) sectors to champion and co-develop public resources relating to digital literacy and wellness.  
  
We look forward to the support and partnership of the 3P sectors to contribute to our wide range of public education efforts, including resource development and other outreach activities.  
  
If you believe in promoting digital literacy and wellness, please get in touch with us at **[info@medialiteracycouncil.sg](mailto:info@medialiteracycouncil.sg)**.
