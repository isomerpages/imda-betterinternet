# **Cyber Bullying**

**Q: A person has been writing bad things about me on social media and posts unflattering photos of me to embarrass me online. I am very affected by this and feel that I have been cyber bullied. What should I do?**

You can consider reporting cyber bullying or harassment issues to the social media platform(s) where you experienced them, as most platforms have functions for users to flag inappropriate behaviours. MLC and Facebook has developed a handout, the Bullying Prevention Hub, to address issue of cyber-bullying which you might refer to for more information. Although the resource is targeted at teens, the principles apply for adults too.


**Q: What is the Protection from Harassment Act 2014 and how can I seek recourse or protection under it?**

The Ministry of Law and Ministry of Home Affairs introduced the Protection from Harassment Act 2014 to further strengthen protection for victims of harassment. The Act makes it an offence to harass others - whether it is committed in the physical word or online. Words or behaviour (including online posts) could be considered harassment if it is threatening, abusive or insulting, thereby causing alarm or distress to another person.

Avenues for self-help and civil remedies for victims of harassment are available under the Act. For instance, victims may apply directly to the State Courts for a Protection Order, which will direct the harasser to stop the harassing behaviour. Find out how to apply for a Protection Order at the State Courts’ website. Victims may also wish to consider getting legal advice from a lawyer, who would be best placed to advise them on the legal options available.

# **Disinformation and Scams**

**Q: What are some practical steps people can take to discern between real and fake news?**

As online users, we should maintain a healthy scepticism over the information that we come across. Some questions to ask in the process of evaluation should include:

*   Have we verified the news with multiple reputable news sources or fact-checking sites?
*   Have we read beyond the headlines? Fake news capture attention with sensational headlines but if we take the time to read the article, it could be about an unrelated topic.
*   Is the article based on first-hand information and directly from an involved party? Or is it from indirect information?
*   How many points of view are represented? Are they from a variety of sources, including official and expert sources?
*   Is the source of information from a reputable news organisation?
*   Is the site a news site, an entertainment or satire site?
*   How independent is the site? Would it have any agendas or biases?


**Q: What should we do when we come across scams online?**

When you encounter online scams, you can report them to the relevant authorities, e.g., the credit card company or the police. If you are not sure what to do, you can also call the Anti-Scam Helpline (1800-722-6688) by the National Crime Prevention Council for help or find out more on [www.scamalert.sg](https://www.scamalert.sg).

# Personal Information and Security

**Q: How can I protect myself from cyber threats like identify theft?**

Always create strong passwords for your online accounts and do not use the same passwords for different accounts. You can create a complex password by using a mix of letters, numbers and symbols.

Also, be alert to email phishing scams that lure you to reveal your personal information (such as login details, credit card information) through emails. Look out for signs, such as spelling mistakes, that may suggest that it is a phishing email.
