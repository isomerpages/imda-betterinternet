**Cyber Bullying**

**Q: A person has been writing bad things about me on social media and posts unflattering photos of me to embarrass me online. I am very affected by this and feel that I have been cyber bullied. What should I do?**

You can consider reporting cyber bullying or harassment issues to the social media platform(s) where you experienced them, as most platforms have functions for users to flag inappropriate behaviours. MLC and Facebook has developed a handout, the Bullying Prevention Hub, to address issue of cyber-bullying which you might refer to for more information. Although the resource is targeted at teens, the principles apply for adults too.


**Q: What is the Protection from Harassment Act 2014 and how can I seek recourse or protection under it?**

The Ministry of Law and Ministry of Home Affairs introduced the Protection from Harassment Act 2014 to further strengthen protection for victims of harassment. The Act makes it an offence to harass others - whether it is committed in the physical word or online. Words or behaviour (including online posts) could be considered harassment if it is threatening, abusive or insulting, thereby causing alarm or distress to another person.

Avenues for self-help and civil remedies for victims of harassment are available under the Act. For instance, victims may apply directly to the State Courts for a Protection Order, which will direct the harasser to stop the harassing behaviour. Find out how to apply for a Protection Order at the State Courts’ website. Victims may also wish to consider getting legal advice from a lawyer, who would be best placed to advise them on the legal options available.
