Since its formation in 2012, the Media Literacy Council has been involved in outreach to our key target groups, such as parents, educators, youth, and seniors. To convey our key messages on media and digital literacies to these audiences, the MLC has organised and planned many events, including youth forums, parent workshops, and award ceremonies.
