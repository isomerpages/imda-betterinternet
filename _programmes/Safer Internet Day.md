Safer Internet Day lands on 5 February 2019 this year!

Safer Internet Day is an annual global initiative that promotes the safe, responsible and positive use of digital technology. The Media Literacy Council (MLC) has been spearheading Singapore’s participation since 2013 through the Better Internet Campaign, in line with the key messages of 'Be Safe, Be Smart, and Be Kind Online'.

The global theme this year is 'Together for a better internet'. The Council launched the Better Internet Campaign with an inaugural [Better Internet Conference](https://www.betterinternet.sg/BIC-Conference-2019) on 11 March at the Singapore Institute of Technology.
