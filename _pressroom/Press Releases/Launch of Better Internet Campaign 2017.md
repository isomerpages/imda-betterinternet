**Targeting Youths & Young Adults Aged 15 to 35 Years Old**

1\. The Media Literacy Council (MLC) celebrates Safer Internet Day (SID) today with the launch of the Better Internet Campaign (‘the Campaign’). The Council has spearheaded the campaign for the fourth time since Singapore’s participation in the global initiative in 2013.

2\. The SID seeks to promote safe and positive use of digital technology, especially among children and young people.

3\. In line with the global theme, MLC has adopted the campaign tagline: “Do What’s Right Online, Be the Change for a Better Internet”. The Campaign will run from 7 February 2017 to 31 May 2017, focusing on current cyber wellness issues of cyber-bullying, discernment and excessive screen time. A showcase of real-life stories of a diverse range of individuals who have personally experienced cyber-wellness issues (including students, educators, counsellors, perpetrators and victims) will also be available at the campaign website at betterinternet.sg. A series of social experiments covering these issues will be conducted to generate awareness, conversations and reflections on the issues.

4\. According to the Zero-to-Fourteen Consumer Experience Study 2015 covering 1200 children conducted by the Info-communications Media Development Authority to understand children’s online and offline media consumption habits, 80 per cent of the children surveyed have used the internet. On average, children started using the internet when they are 6 years old and may become susceptible to online problems at younger ages. In a separate survey among 3,800 secondary and 1,800 upper primary school students conducted by TOUCH Cyber Wellness in 2015, 33 per cent of the secondary students had experienced cyber bullying and 25 per cent had bullied someone online. 22 per cent of the primary school students had experienced cyber bullying, which is an increase of 4 per cent compared to a similar survey in 2014. Research studies in 2014 by Singapore Children Society and Institute of Mental Health showed links between cyber bullying experiences and self-harming behaviour in victims. Our campaign activities which include a series of on-ground engagements and broadcasts on mainstream and social media, will bring more awareness and discussions about these issues.

5\. Mr Lock Wai Han, Chairman of the Media Literacy Council, said: “The internet and mobile devices have become an integral part of our lives, especially among our young people. It is therefore critical to encourage our youths to be positive online, while giving them the resilience, knowledge and support they need to navigate online risks. With the proliferation of news sources online, we need to be discerning to distinguish between falsehood and the truth, to avoid falling prey to scams and fake news.”

This year’s global theme - “Be the Change: Unite for a Better Internet” - emphasises the importance of collaboration and unity.
