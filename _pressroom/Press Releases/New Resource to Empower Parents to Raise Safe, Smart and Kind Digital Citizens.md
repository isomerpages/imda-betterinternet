**Better Internet Campaign to Target Youths, Parents, Seniors & General Public**

1\. This year's Better Internet Campaign (BIC) marks the launch of a 20-page parent resource jointly produced by international think tank Digital Quotient (DQ) Institute and the Media Literacy Council (MLC). The resource will be translated into the official languages of Singapore with Twitter’s support.

2\. As part of the BIC, DQ Institute and Media Literacy Council are partnering with various stakeholders, including Twitter for translation and venue support, the National Library Board for venue support, TOUCH Cyber Wellness and MENDAKI to conduct 40 digital literacy workshops for parents. Companies can also approach the MLC to conduct workshops for their employees at their offices. In addition, an online portal with useful resources will be made available to parents at a later date. These initiatives mark the annual Safer Internet Day (SID) and the launch of the fifth edition of BIC. MLC has spearheaded the campaign since Singapore’s participation in the global initiative in 2013.

3\. In line with the global theme, BIC will adopt the campaign tagline “Be Safe, Be Smart & Be Kind Online”, and will run from 6 February to 31 December 2018. The campaign seeks to promote safe and responsible use of digital technology targeting youths, parents, seniors and the general public. Key issues that the campaign will focus on include cyber-bullying, discernment (fact checking) and cyber safety and security.

4\. To increase the public’s accessibility of the resources, bite-sized instructional content through online videos on cyber-bullying and discerning online content (through fact-checking), a television commercial on cyber safety and security for seniors, as well as social media content and tip sheets covering these issues will be produced to generate awareness, conversations and reflections on the issues among the various target audiences according to their needs.

5\. Mr Lock Wai Han, Chairman of the Media Literacy Council, said: “Parents play a pivotal role in their children’s well-being and face new challenges in today’s digital society, as children are exposed to digital devices at an earlier age. With the launch of the DQ parent resource which MLC worked with DQ institute to produce, we hope to better equip parents with information and skills to encourage their children to navigate the digital world safely, smartly and responsibly. This year’s campaign also sees the MLC strengthening its efforts to combat fake news and promote discernment among individuals through online instructional videos and resources aimed at raising public awareness and education on fact-checking.”

6\. Dr Park Yuhyun, founder of the DQ Institute, said “We found that the parental role is pivotal for children's online safety and development of digital intelligence. It is important to give parents tools that can be easily used at home, to empower parents and children together. We hope that this campaign supports families in becoming more digitally healthy.”

7\. Yayasan MENDAKI, a self-help group, supports the Better Internet Campaign. Its Chief Executive Officer, Mdm Rahayu Buang said, “We are excited to bring the DQ parent resource to our community and also to translate the workshops in Malay Language so that more parents can benefit from the workshops conducted”.

8\. Mr Philip Chua, Public Policy Manager, Asia Pacific at Twitter, said “Safety is a core priority for us at Twitter. The next generation is growing up at a radically different time where mobile, social, and Internet savviness are a given. Our Safer Internet Day collaboration with the Media Literacy Council on workshops and resources is an important step to enable parents to keep up with their kids in this digital age and grow together as a digitally savvy, discerning community.”

9\. Mrs Anita Low-Lim, Senior Director of TOUCH Community Services’ Children & Youth Group, said: “TOUCH Cyber Wellness believes that cyber wellness awareness and education begins at home and in school. As the appointed training partner of both the DQ World programme for children and the DQ Parents programme, we are glad to collaborate with MLC and DQ Institute in holistically raising safe, smart and kind digital citizens.”

10\. Community efforts can also be seen as this year’s campaign will also showcase the top five winning student-led community initiatives supported under the Better Internet x Youths Call for Proposals (CFP) launched by the MLC on 13 April 2017, which attracted over 51 applications. Joining the MLC in its celebration of SID is social enterprise Make the Change which has launched a programme where youths are trained to be facilitators to conduct Digital Arts workshops for target beneficiaries, while CHIJ Katong Primary School will be launching a cyber-wellness education and outreach project to the community (please refer to Annex A for the list of other CFP activities throughout the campaign).
