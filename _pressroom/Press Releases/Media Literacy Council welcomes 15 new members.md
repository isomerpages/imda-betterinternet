**15 new members from the academic, legal, telecommunications and social sectors have joined the Media Literacy Council (MLC) to help drive public education on media literacy and digital citizenship, and advise the government on the policy responses to these emerging issues.**

Professor Tan Cheng Han from the Faculty of Law of the National University of Singapore and Mrs. Carmee Lim, a mentor principal of MindChamps Holdings Pte Ltd, have been re-appointed as Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the MLC respectively.

The new MLC members are Mr Jeffrey Ali (_MediaCorp_); Dr Damien Cheong (_S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, NTU_); Mdm Chew Bee Lay (_Alexandra Primary School_); Mr Chong Ee Jay (_TOUCH Community Services_); Associate Professor Angeline Khoo (_National Institute of Education_); Ms Iris Lin (_Fei Yue Community Services_); Associate Professor Lim Sun Sun (_Department of Communications &amp; New Media, NUS_); Mr Oliver Loke (_National Council of Social Service_); Associate Professor May Oo Lwin (_Wee Kim Wee School of Communications, NTU_); Mdm Ng Chen Kee (_Crescent Girls' School_); Mr See Wee Heng (_AspirantSG.com_); Dr Carol Soon (_Institute of Policy Studies_); Ms Aileen Tan (_SingTel_); Mr Bryan Tan (_Pinsent Masons_); and Mr Steve Tan (_NTUC_).

11 MLC members will be staying on for a second term, while 10 have stepped down.

“With the surge and convergence of media platforms, media literacy and responsible online participation are becoming increasingly important. The MLC plays a critical role in promoting public awareness through education programmes on media literacy and cyber-wellness. I would like to thank all MLC members, past and present, for their invaluable contributions and their efforts to help the public navigate an increasingly complex media space,” says Dr Yaccob Ibrahim, Minister for Communications and Information.

MLC Chairman, Professor Tan Cheng Han said: “As MLC moves into the new term, we will continue to build on what we’ve already rolled out to reach more segments of society. Through our programmes, we hope to empower Singaporeans to harness the benefits of the Internet and media.”

The MLC was first formed on 1 August 2012 and its tenure has been renewed for another two-year term. Since its formation, the MLC has rolled out a series of collaborations with industry and educational partners to promote cyber wellness and media literacy.

Most notably, the MLC spearheaded Singapore’s inaugural participation in the global Safer Internet Day[1] (SID) initiative in 2013 and rides on the event annually to raise awareness of the need for safe and responsible use of online technology.

MLC also reached out to various segments of the community over the past two years. For students and youths, MLC reached out to them through innovative and engaging ways such as a customisable Media Smart Badge programme and tertiary orientation programme. More notably, a three-year partnership was inked with the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) which saw the introduction of the Media Smart Club Co-Curricula Activity (CCA) and Media Smart Day orientation programme across all ITE campuses. The Council also worked closely with like-minded partners, through participating and engaging audiences at relevant events as well as creating useful resources to guide parents and seniors. These resources include a e-newsletter, classroom curriculum and activity kits, parenting guides and tipsheets, and video clips, and can be downloaded on the MLC website, which is also updated with regular articles on media literacy.

Besides public education, the MLC was also consulted on several issues by government agencies ranging from remote gambling to online piracy to cyber harassment to internet parental control tools and media regulation.

The MLC will continue to be supported by a secretariat team from the Media Development Authority (MDA). For more information, please visit medialiteracycouncil.sg
