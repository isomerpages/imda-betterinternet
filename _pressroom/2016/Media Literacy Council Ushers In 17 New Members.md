**Singapore – 27 July 2016** 

The Media Literacy Council (MLC) will welcome 17 new members from the public, private and people sectors as it commences its third two-year term on 1 August 2016.

Appointed by Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, Minister for Communications and Information, the new MLC will comprise 30 members from diverse sectors spanning business, academia, social and community organisations, up from 26 in the last term. They will collectively offer their expertise to raise the awareness of media literacy issues, help drive public education efforts, and promote a safe and responsible Internet environment.

Leading the MLC will be its new Chairman Mr Lock Wai Han, former Executive Director and Group CEO at Rowsley Ltd. Besides Mr Lock, the 16 other new members are: Mr Alvin Tan, Mr Andrew Lim, Ms Anita Kuan, Mrs Christine Lam, Ms Gam Huey Yi, Ms Irene Ang, Mr Jeff Cheong, Dr Jiow Hee Jhee, Mr Kumaran Barathan, Ms Natasha Zhao, Ms Stephanie Hung, Ms Susan Ng, Mrs Tan Wan Yu, Mr Tong Yee, Mr Walter Lim, and Mdm Zulaiha Bte Yusuf.

13 members, including former MLC Chairman Professor Tan Cheng Han, will step down.

“Over the past four years, the MLC has contributed significantly to increasing the awareness of media literacy issues such as Internet safety and cyber-bullying, particularly among students and parents through its annual Safer Internet Day campaign and programmes with partners and schools. As the online environment continues to evolve and grow in complexity, the role that the MLC plays has become even more important,” said Dr Yaacob. “I would like to thank out-going MLC Chairman Professor Tan Cheng Han, and all past MLC members who have contributed their invaluable time and insights to this cause, and I look forward to working with the new council to take their efforts even further.”

The MLC will continue to be supported by a secretariat team from the Media Development Authority (MDA). For more information, please visit [www.medialiteracycouncil.sg](http://www.medialiteracycouncil.sg)
